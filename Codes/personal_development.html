                The Twelve Pillars is a story about an old man named Charlie bestowing the life lessons taught by Mr. Davis
                to a young man named Michael. Each chapter denotes an important life lesson necessary to achieve a successful livelihood.
                Within chapters 4 to 7, Charlie expresses the importance of the following four lessons.
            </p>
        
            <ol type="1;" style="padding: 25px;">
                <li>Writing your goals is the first step to achieving them.</li>
                <li>Surround yourself with people who share your goals and ambition. Influence is a powerful tool to excel.</li>
                <li>Make the best of your day because time is of the essence. Your life is your hands, make the choices and sacrifices necessary to grasp your happiness.</li>
                <li>Be a lifelong learner. Never stop reading, never stop questioning and remain open & observant.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>
                Similar to Michael, I find these lessons insightful and inspiring. Many times people are led to accept life as it is;
                never seeking more or believing more is possible. These lessons motivate me to keep going, despite the obstacles like Charlie said Dream Big.
                Sometimes all one needs is a dream and this dream can take you farther when you take the time to invest in it.
                The first two life lessons are already routine practices. I continue to write down my goals and have long removed those from my life who do not share my ambition.
                The last two are teachings in need of extra practice. Whilst I love reading, I do not spend enough time reading nor read enough books that matter. One of my goals
                this year is to read a classic literatur novel; yes, I'll be sure to write this goal. Lately, I have been working on investing my time into myself, instead
                of making excuses about why I cannot do this. Excuses feed doubt and procrastination. I no longer plan to entertain such seeds of unproductivity.
                The Twelve Pillars is the sort of novel one stumbles upon yet never regrets opening. I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn from its pages.
